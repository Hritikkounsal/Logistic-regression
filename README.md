:arrow_forward: **LOGISTIC REGRESSION**

By the name, many get confused that it falls under regression. But NO! Logistic regression is one of the popular and most widely used algorithms for classification problems. We must be able to differentiate between these two problems ( the outputs for regression are CONTINOUS VALUES where classification has DISCRETE values). Classification can be:
</br>1. Binary classification - Email Spam Filtering, a tumor being malignant or not.</br>
2. Multiclass classification -  Movie ratings such as A, U, A/U etc.</br>
